# WlanRouterPositioningSystem
A WebApp in concert with a set of WlanSensors shows you live on a HeatMap the perfect place for your WlanAccessPoint.
So instead of running  with your sensor(eg Smartphone) through all your rooms and garden mapping a certain wlan quality dsitribution for a certain AccessPoint position.
And repeat this 2,3,..6.. times till you found the perfect spot for the AccessPoint.
Do it the other way around.
Take a bunch of cheap Wlan-Quality-Sensors(part of this project) distribute them all over your hom (most wlan-relevant spots)and walk around with your access point and see on your smartphone how the wlan quality at all points.
As soon as all are at a max./acceptable level, you found your perfect spot for the accesspoint.

Realy good its getting when things get complicated. Home is too big, or walls are not allowing complete coverage.
Then you would have to do this twice or trice. So tripple the efforts with the first method vs. the second method.
The secodn method scales and gives you the chance of a real statement.

How ever, this is more a tool for professionals or for you + friends, neighbours.
Most private people might feel ok with an avarage AP-Position, and just buy a second one, and hope all is good enough.
But for a professional this could make the difference between data based recomandation and a merely good guess.
